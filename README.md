## ðŸ“œ About the project
<p>This project is about saving all the tools you may consider usefull in only one place. Nothing really innovative, but it was quite fun to do it. </p>

<p>This is a challenge made by <a href="https://app.bossabox.com">BossaBox</a>. The idea was to do a layout that consumes an external API following some rules and instructions. You can find the fake API to consume <a href="https://gitlab.com/bossabox/challenge-fake-api/tree/master">here</a>.</p>

I have used this project to improve my ReactJS skills and learn how to prototype a layout. I have used [figma](https://www.figma.com/) for the prototype and it can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/F0dWLzpKyocZYBIxAAPmur/VUTTR?node-id=0%3A1).
